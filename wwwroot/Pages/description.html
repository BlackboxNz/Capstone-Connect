                    As students at the University of Auckland approach and complete their final year of studies, 
                    they are required
                    to complete a "Capstone" course.
                </p>
                <p id="text">
                    Students of Computer Science are required to assemble teams and liaise with a given
                    client, with the ultimate goal of developing and showcasing a product that meets both
                    the demands of the client as well as the standards of the development team.

                <p id="text">
                    This product is typically a piece of software like a website, an app, or even
                    a game. These "Capstone" projects
                    put to test the knowledge that students have accrued over the course of their tertiary endeavours,
                    both in the realm of Computer Science and outside of it.
                </p>
                <p id="text">
                    These projects are our way to showcase what all the early mornings,
                    the sleepless nights, the study sessions - productive or otherwise - have amounted to.
                </p>
                <p id="text">
                    All this having been said, there still remains the question:

                    Our clients - Our very own Anna and Asma - asked prospective developers to create
                    a centralized online hub where COMPSCI 399 students could share their projects with
                    each other and the rest of the world.

                    And so, Black Box NZ was formed! Consisting of 5 third-year Computer Science
                    students with varying skills and areas of expertise, we have worked tirelessly throughout
                    the semester to bring your our solution to this problem: Capstone Connect.
                </p>
                <p id="text">
                    Capstone Connect is the result of months of grinding out code, days of lost sleep,
                    hours of meetings both with clients and each other. Put simply, we at Black Box have
                    poured everything into presenting you the best possible product that we are capable
                    of creating.

                    So, please, stay a while! Browse our peers' projects, comment any feedback you may have,
                    and leave a like to support your favorites.
